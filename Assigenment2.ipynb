    "Question - Explain the key  features of lists in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Certainly! Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python. Here are the key features of lists:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        1. Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements. This means that elements have a specific position, and you can access them using their index. The indexing starts at 0.\n",
    "        2. Mutable: Lists can be modified after they are created. You can change, add, or remove elements from a list. This is in contrast to tuples, which are immutable.\n",
    "        3. Dynamic Size: Lists can grow and shrink in size. You can append elements, remove elements, or insert elements at specific positions.\n",
    "        4. Heterogeneous: Lists can contain elements of different types. For example, a single list can include integers, strings, and even other lists.\n",
    "        5. Indexed Access: You can access elements of a list using indexing. Negative indices can be used to access elements from the end of the list, where -1 refers to the last element, -2 refers to the second-to-last element, and so on.\n",
    "        6. Slicing: Lists support slicing, which allows you to access a subset of elements. For example, my_list[1:4] will return a new list containing elements from index 1 to 3.\n",
    "        7. Iterable: Lists are iterable, which means you can use loops, such as for loops, to iterate over the elements in a list.\n",
    "        8. Methods and Functions: Lists come with a variety of built-in methods, such as .append(), .extend(), .insert(), .remove(), .pop(), .sort(), and .reverse(), which provide powerful ways to manipulate the list.\n",
    "        9. List Comprehensions: Python supports list comprehensions, which provide a concise way to create lists. For example, [x**2 for x in range(10)] generates a list of squares of numbers from 0 to 9.\n",
    "        10. Nested Lists: Lists can contain other lists as elements. This allows for the creation of multi-dimensional arrays or matrices.\n",
    "        11. Dynamic Typing: Python lists can dynamically change their type of contents. This means you can have a list where some elements are integers, and others are strings or even other lists.\n",
    "        12. Performance Considerations: Lists are implemented as dynamic arrays in Python, which means they can efficiently handle appending elements, though operations like inserting elements in the middle or removing elements can be slower as the list grows larger.\n"

    "Importance of Immutable Dictionary Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing Requirement :- Python dictionaries use a hash table to manage key-value pairs. This requires that dictionary keys be hashable, which means they must have a hash value that remains constant during their lifetime. Hash values are used to quickly locate keys in the dictionary. If the key were mutable and its value changed, its hash value would also change, potentially causing inconsistencies and errors in key lookup.\n",

    "Immutability: Immutable types like strings, numbers, and tuples (with immutable elements) are suitable for dictionary keys because their hash values do not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hashing: The requirement for keys to be immutable ensures that their hash values are consistent, enabling efficient and reliable dictionary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance and Integrity: Immutable keys help maintain the performance and integrity of the dictionary by ensuring that keys cannot change in a way that would disrupt the hash table.\n",

    "Understanding and adhering to the immutability requirement for dictionary keys is essential for effective and error-free use of Python dictionaries.\n"
